My interests are:

- Music
##My Technical background:
I have only been studying computer science for a year now and don't have much experience to show just yet, but I have gained a proficiency in Python from the classes that I have taken here.
My favorite class project that I have worked on was a text-based rpg where the player traverses the map to collect certain items to win the game, meeting all kinds of npcs along the way.
